/*
    This file is a simpe mixin that allow the react modules to work with
    local browser cache, this mixin uses the Storage service created at the
    utils folder and can and should be used in any component that use some
    non-permanent data to set it's states. It will also automatically set
    ALL of the component state to the browser local cache.

    Some common uses of this mixin would be:
    - Tabs/Panels
    - Open/Closed boxes
    - Modals (some cases)
